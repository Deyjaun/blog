Write a program to print numbers from 1 to 10 using a for loop.

i first started with adding 
,,,
(for x in range (1,11,1):
'''
 this sets the start number to one and counts by one till you get to ten then i did print(x) which prints numbers from 1-10 because 11 is the limit and the number will pint numbers from 1-10 if we did just 11 it would print numbers 0-10


Write a program to count by 10s from 900 to 1000


for y in range (900,1001,10):#Starts at 900 and counts by 10 to 1000
    print(y)#prints numbers 900 to 1000 counting up by 10s
"""
Exercise 3:
Write a program that counts form 1-100 by 9
"""

for z in range (1,101,9):#starts at 1 and counts to 100 in intervals of 9
   print(z) #prints numbers 1-100 counting up by 9


Write a program to calculate the sum of all numbers from 1 to 10 using a for loop.

sum = 0 #sets sum = 0
for z in range (1,11):#Prints from 1-10
    sum+=z #adds to sum
print(sum) #Prints the sum
